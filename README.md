## Summary
This script summarizes critical election results that users would find relevant and useful. Election commissions can provide other important reporting metrics, such as political party or age, and the script can be easily modified to provide statistics on these metrics. For instance, the script could calculate vote totals and vote percentages by policital party. The script could also be modified to calculate statistical measures, such as the average age of voters by county, candidate, or policital party.
